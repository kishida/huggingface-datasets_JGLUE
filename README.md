## Dataset Description

- **Homepage:** https://github.com/yahoojapan/JGLUE
- **Repository:** https://github.com/shunk031/huggingface-datasets_JGLUE

### Dataset Summary

> JGLUE, Japanese General Language Understanding Evaluation, is built to measure the general NLU ability in Japanese. JGLUE has been constructed from scratch without translation. We hope that JGLUE will facilitate NLU research in Japanese.

> JGLUE has been constructed by a joint research project of Yahoo Japan Corporation and Kawahara Lab at Waseda University.

While the English NLU benchmark, GLUE, has been the forerunner, benchmarks are now being released for languages other than English, such as CLUE for Chinese and FLUE for French; but there is no such benchmark for Japanese. We build a Japanese NLU benchmark, JGLUE, from scratch without translation to measure the general NLU ability in Japanese. We hope that JGLUE will facilitate NLU research in Japanese.",
